# Election Information System

Group Project: Semester 3


## Description

This project allows the user to add new elections to the system, add new candidates to an election and record their total votes in that election, add political parties and add politicians to a party, along with CRUD functionality for each of these.
The user can filter elections by type or year, search politicians by name, party or residing County or just view lists of stored details.
Data can be saved via xml and loaded from a previously saved xml file. Hashmaps were implemented to sort and create seamless searching for data.

An assortment of J-Unit tests are included ensuring method's integrity despite code refactoring.
